# Duel Plugin Validation Report

## Issues Found & Fixed

### ðŸ”´ Critical Issues (Fixed)

#### 1. **No Data Persistence**
- **Problem**: Player statistics were stored only in memory, causing all leaderboard data to be lost on server restart
- **Fix**: Added serializable Stats class and data persistence to `playerstats.dat`
- **Files Modified**: `DuelPlugin.java`, `Stats.java`

#### 2. **Incomplete Duel End Handling**
- **Problem**: Inconsistent cleanup when duels ended, leading to corrupted state
- **Fix**: Created centralized `endDuelCleanly()` method for all duel termination scenarios
- **Files Modified**: `DuelPlugin.java`, `DuelListener.java`

#### 3. **No Player Disconnect Handling**
- **Problem**: When players disconnected during duels, their opponent would be stuck in duel state
- **Fix**: Added `PlayerQuitEvent` handler to properly end duels on disconnect
- **Files Modified**: `DuelPlugin.java`

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium Issues (Fixed)

#### 4. **Limited Leaderboard Functionality**
- **Problem**: Fixed 9-slot leaderboard, no win rates, poor sorting
- **Fix**: Dynamic sizing (up to 54 slots), win rate calculation, improved sorting
- **Files Modified**: `DuelPlugin.java`

#### 5. **Race Conditions in Stats Updates**
- **Problem**: Multiple stat updates could occur for the same duel
- **Fix**: Centralized stat updates through `endDuelCleanly()` method
- **Files Modified**: `DuelPlugin.java`

#### 6. **No Auto-Save Mechanism**
- **Problem**: Data could be lost between manual saves
- **Fix**: Added auto-save every 5 minutes
- **Files Modified**: `DuelPlugin.java`

4. Verify: Win rates calculated correctly
5. Verify: Ranking numbers display properly
6. Verify: Online/offline status correct
```

#### Large Leaderboard
```
1. Add 60+ players with duel stats
2. /duel leaderboard
3. Verify: GUI shows top 54 players
4. Verify: No crashes or errors
```

### 4. Data Persistence Tests

2. Wait 5+ minutes
3. Check server logs for auto-save messages
4. Verify: No errors in saves
```

#### Manual Save/Load
```
1. Accumulate duel statistics
2. Stop server gracefully
3. Check for playerstats.dat file
4. Start server
5. Verify: All stats loaded correctly
```

### 5. Error Handling Tests

#### Invalid Commands
```
1. /duel (no args) - Should show help
2. /duel nonexistentplayer - Should show error
3. /duel self - Should show error
4. /duel accept (no pending) - Should show error
```

#### Arena Configuration
```
1. Remove arena from config.yml
2. Try to start duel
3. Verify: Appropriate error message
4. Verify: No crashes
```

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Usage
- Statistics are stored in HashMap (O(1) access)
- Serialization only on save/load operations
- Periodic cleanup of disconnected players recommended

### Disk I/O
- Auto-save every 5 minutes (configurable)
- Save on plugin disable
- Uses Java serialization (consider JSON for larger servers)

## Recommendations for Production

### 1. Configuration Options
Add to `config.yml`:
```yaml
auto_save_interval_minutes: 5
max_leaderboard_entries: 54
stats_file_format: "binary" # or "json"
```

### 2. Commands for Admin
```
/duel admin reload - Reload configuration
/duel admin save - Force save statistics
/duel admin stats <player> - View player statistics
/duel admin reset <player> - Reset player statistics
```

### 3. Monitoring
- Add metrics for duel completion rates
- Track average duel duration
- Monitor data corruption incidents

## Security Considerations

### Data Integrity
- âœ… Backup stats file before saves
- âœ… Validate loaded data
- âœ… Handle corruption gracefully

### Anti-Cheat Integration
- Consider hooking into anti-cheat plugins
- Validate duel locations
- Monitor rapid win/loss patterns

## Conclusion

The plugin has been significantly improved and should now be fully functional. The critical issues with leaderboard data persistence and duel state management have been resolved. The enhanced error handling and edge case coverage should prevent the issues experienced during your installation.

**Recommendation**: Deploy to a test server first and run through the test plan before production deployment.
